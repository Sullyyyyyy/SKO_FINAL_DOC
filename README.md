Week 1:
Week 1 was the introduction to coding, we downloaded various apps to get started, and we were introduced to HTML, Github, and Visual Studio code, which we were going to use later throughout the semester. Our first task was to design a page called Hello World! Using a chosen image as the background we coded our font and design on the page as our first step into coding, this allowed us to practice the simple uses of coding. We also had various readings that we read through as a way to grasp some knowledge about this new topic.

Week 2:
Week 2 was about learning about Github, a place to put all our coded work for review and viewing by our peers and teachers. We learned how to make repositories that hold all the files and create a website URL with our code. This felt like a proper first step into coding and was interesting to learn. We also learned about some case studies that the lecturers provided. Another task we did was to create poetry from the chosen text. We then coded that in a way that made the lettering unique.

Week 3:
This week was about picking our topics for A1 (assignment 1) and picking a text to use for our paper prototype, I chose Hito Steryl's In Defense of the Poor Image as my topic, we also were introduced to javascript and were given a task to create a face of ourselves using simples shapes, first on paper then coded it, we were given different shapes to explore and it was a unique and funny experience learning about how to position and hierarchy work in shapes.

Week 4:
We started our ski ideas and started to finish up our first assignment, the paper prototype, I chose an idea similar to poker chips on a table, and clicking the chips would open up the page showing all the reflections and work we completed that week, it was just rough sketches and ideas to brainstorm during class. We also fiddled around with cursor effects, experimenting with different types of interactive code, it was quite an interesting class as it provided a lot of important coding and questions. 

Week 5:
Week 5 was a mid-semester break so I used that as a way to catch up on any work that I was behind on, mostly used that time to read about some articles that were given by our teachers to read, for example, Richard. A. Lanhams what's next for text? It was a text that we were required to read.

Week 6:
Week 6 was further improvements and catch-up, as we were just finishing up a mid-semester break, so I was moving on to the main project and designing some storyboards and visuals for the overall concept that I was going with. Overall this week was getting back into the swing of things.

Week 7:
During week 7 we learned about hover effects, mainly how to code them, We used different types of coding and samples to create various cursor effects, such as images duplicating and following the mouse, and words popping up all over the screen, it was a great way to further our coding knowledge.

Week 8:
During week 8 we focused on making sound effects, we chose audio and attempted to code it and make various sound effects, I chose a screaming sound effect but I struggled with making the sound work as for some reason my files weren't working, ultimately I still couldn't figure it out thus the file doesn't work but I have screenshotted my code and tried to make it work.

Week 9:
During week 9 we experimented with lettering and how to make interactive effects using wriggly letters/font, this allowed us to learn how to play with the font for our final project, We also worked on our SKO and final project as we only had a couple of weeks left to gain feedback on them. This week overall offered various improvements to my final project, such as merging different codes to create a new and improved code.

Week 10:
During week 10 we worked on various layers within a canvas, rendering the effects through coding as a class, It was a great way to improve our coding as a class and use this newly learned code towards our SKOs and major projects, We also had a look at various articles.

Week 11:
Week 11 was mainly focused on working on our assignments, although we did work on how to make box shadows and experimented with the code on that, it was a challenge to learn but interesting nonetheless. My assignment was starting to form up into its final form although still had a lot of improvements and feedback that I needed.

Week 12/13: 
Unfortunately, during week 12 our tutors weren't here for this week but I received some feedback from my peers, Elijah and Peran, we helped each other out and gave each other constructive criticism, During week 13 was our last week of class so we had to finish our projects and almost complete our SKO, the class was held just to get that final bit of feedback from our tutors.
